## Next Steps

1. **Run Integration Tests**
   - Execute the integration test suite to verify all improvements
   - Document any remaining issues

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Measure actual bundle size and verify it meets the target (<600KB)
   - Validate page transition times meet the target (<350ms)
   - Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab for measurement

3. **Final Verification**
